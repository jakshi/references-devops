## What is DevOps

* [ENG] https://theagileadmin.com/what-is-devops/
* [ENG] What Team Structure is Right for DevOps to Flourish? http://web.devopstopologies.com/
* [RUS} https://habr.com/en/company/jugru/blog/487958/

### [ENG] General definition
DevOps is the practice of operations and development engineers participating together in the entire service lifecycle, from design through the development process to production support. 

### [ENG] Extended definition
DevOps is CRISP approach with CALMS as its principles and values

CRISP:

* C – Collaborative way of working between Dev and Ops (One Team – One Goal)
* R – Repeatable process using principles and practices to provide better results to deliver the QUALITY and STABLE product/application
* I – Iterative and Incremental approach for continuous improvement
* S – Saleable across multiple teams of the product
* P – People, Principle, Practices and process oriented disciplinary collaborative approach

CALMS:

* C – Culture (promotes collaborative and open culture between Dev and Ops)
* A – Automation (automate wherever applicable)
* L- Learning (continuous learning & experimentation)
* M – Measure (Measure with shared metrics across the Dev and ops for better management)
* S – Sharing (Shared delivery process across Dev and Ops to build , deploy, maintain and monitor product with mentality of One Team – One Goal)

### [ENG] Additional notes
DevOps is also characterized by operations staff making use many of the same techniques as developers for their systems work. 

### [ENG] My personal definition/view/notes

* DevOps is using agile development practices and agile culture in application to managing IT infrastructure.
* The goal is also the same - faster delivery, faster feedback cycle.
* DevOps is about Continuous Improvement idea.
* And important part of that idea is 'no blame' culture.
* There're several definition of DevOps around the net.
* Personally I like CALMS definition of continuous improvement cycle:
  * Culture (no blame, collaboration, openness)
  * Automation (Infrastructure as a Code and automation in general)
  * Learning (continuous learning)
  * Measurement (agile monitoring)
  * Sharing ( again - collaboration, teams can do more than 1 person)
* I would like to note that DevOps usually doesn't work partially.
* For example: if you would remove Measurement (It seems strange - but I saw companies that did exactly that) - you would break that self-improvement cycle.
* If culture will be removed - people will be afraid to move fast (as people that do nothing - don't do mistakes)
