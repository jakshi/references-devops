Entertaining, easy to read and very insightful book from Jon Ronson about how to tell if a person is a psychopath, but also showing how easy it is to make a mistake and label people incorrectly, sometimes with terrible consequences.

Applying the lessons into the hiring process, the key takeaway for me is that the companies should NEVER hire people who:

* don't accept #responsibility for own actions; let the person talk about #mistakes they've made, lessons they've learned and what they'd do differently (signal to flag: they don't take any #ownership and keep blaming people around them)
* don't show any #empathy when describing events such as layoffs, someone getting fired etc., events that painfully affected lives and families of their past colleagues (signal to flag: justifying with #cold wording, e.g. "they've been asking for it", "they should have seen it coming", "that's what you get for ..")
* don't show any #humility or at least some #awareness of own limits (signal to flag: the person doesn't admit there are things they don't know or never had a chance to work with; I usually appreciate soft wording along the lines "I may be wrong..", "if I remember correctly..", "what we've tried and turned out to work for us back then..", etc.)
* are #impulsive and #impatient (signal to flag: they interrupt you in the middle of the question, or when you're trying to help them - I often see this during coding interviews when giving person some clues they sometimes get angry, say "I know, I know!"; look for people who can listen, take some time to think first, and know how to receive feedback and ask for help)
* are #unable to show any #remorse or guilt; related to lack of empathy and not taking ownership for own mistakes (signal to flag: the person has no regrets, constantly justifying past behaviors as something that "had to be done", is unable to say "I'm sorry")

Malevolent personalities can cause a lot of damage to the company (on top of the emotional damage they cause to their colleagues of course), and it can take long time to identify them. So.. Good Luck!
